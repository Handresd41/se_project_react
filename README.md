# SE_Project_React

This projects check the weather and display the tempeture and what type of clothes to wear according to the condition. And it allows user to change Fahrenheit to Celsius. And while also adding clothes. Also delete items when you don't need them anymore. Including that it has a profile view.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
